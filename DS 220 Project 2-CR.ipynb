It includes data on household income, population, educational achievement (such as eighth-grade math scores and high school completion rates), and college attendance. The database also covers health and lifestyle metrics like average IQ, obesity rates, smoking prevalence, and the percentage of the population engaging in physical activities or consuming recommended daily amounts of vegetables and fruits. Additionally, it contains economic indicators like Gross State Product (GSP), along with political and demographic information, including electoral votes, election outcomes, racial composition, and family structures.
